Abstract: Video Cartoonization System
The Video Cartoonization System aims to transform real-world video content into cartoon-like representations, offering a novel approach to creating visually engaging animations. This project leverages advanced techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and OpenCV-based image processing, to achieve high-quality cartoonization effects.

Designed with user accessibility in mind, the system enables individuals to upload videos, adjust customizable parameters, and seamlessly generate cartoon-style outputs. By integrating state-of-the-art technology with an intuitive user interface, the project aspires to redefine video editing and animation creation for diverse applications.
